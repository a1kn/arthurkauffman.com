      <description>Javascript is funky. Wrapping my head around nested functions feels a little nuts after learning a language like Ruby.
Complicating it even more is the shift from ES5 to ES6, where ES5 always used the function keyword and ES6 includes fancy new arrow functions.
Big difference, besides less typing of the word &amp;lsquo;function&amp;rsquo;? Implicit return. Arrow functions, declared with a weird arrow rocket (=&amp;gt;), can implicitly return their value when the function is called.</description>

      <description>Yesterday my Pop OS install got borked and instead of fixing it, since I&amp;rsquo;m bored at home and self-quarantined anyway, decided to try installing Arch Linux. First time, and how hard could it be anyway?
Got it done finally, and learned a lot along the way. Here are some notes to speed it up next time.
  Boot into my Windows partition, download the Arch ISO, use Rufus to make a bootable drive, and boot into Arch.</description>
